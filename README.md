# Challenge One

For this challenge I had to refactor a website for better HTML and CSS syntax. I was given an HTML file and CSS file that were functioning but not formatted in an easy to use way. I have listed out the major changes that I made below.

* Added alt descriptions to all images
* Added links to connect to images
* Added notes to HTML and CSS to show sections of each file
* Changed beginning syntax of the three sections from <div> to nav, main, and aside. To allow for easier navigation.
    * Also changed these titles in css for solidarity between files 
* Updated navigation bar links with ID’s further down their code so that it jumps to that section when clicked 
* Consolidated CSS code by adding same class to sections that looked the same. Then deleted the extra code in CSS
* Moved “benefits” CSS to bottom of file to follow alongside html
* Removed unnecessary parts of CSS  code
* General formatting and editing to ensure that HTML and CSS were in same order
